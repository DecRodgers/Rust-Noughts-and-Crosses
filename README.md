# Rust-Noughts-and-Crosses

The second assignment for the Secure Programming (COMP10068) module for UWS 21-22. was quite a chellenge to get this working, and an appreciation for Rust over C/C++has been developed.
Not pleased with the check board method, but it works. Would have prefered to use a match expression for HashMap contents, not sure how to do that.
